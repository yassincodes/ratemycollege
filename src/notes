make a function that will add always when you click
make different buttons when you click each one something will happen
try a different way to crud 
-----------------
first of all we do a useEffect to get info and store it in todoList2
(what I should do is to check if todoList is getting data or not by just running a map function)
the data should be :
stored in an array and then do some calculation
or it should be by running a function 
let s = 0
s = s + fuck.firstrating
return s
